Comprehensive Framework and Design Document for Text-Based RPG

Overview
========
- Game Name: To be determined
- Genre: Text-based RPG with turn-based combat
- Platform: PC and Android
- Development Environment: Processing 4.3 (Java)
- Setting: Low-tech fantasy environment with magical elements

Core Gameplay Loop
==================
1. Ability Loadout Setup: Players configure their abilities before battles.
2. Turn-Based Combat: Automated battles where actions are rolled from ability pools.
3. Post-Battle Rewards: Players receive rewards and can modify abilities.
4. Customization: Players can adjust their ability loadout between battles.
5. Game Saves: Progress is encoded in a text file.

Game Structure
==============
Game Screens
------------
1. New Game Screen
   - Initiate a new game.
   - Load saved games.
   - Enter player name.

2. Reward Screen
   - Display post-battle rewards.
   - Allow ability customization.

3. Customization Screen
   - Manage and configure ability loadouts.

4. Battle Screen
   - Display and manage turn-based combat.

5. Story Screen
   - Present story elements and decision-making opportunities.

Game Screen Interface
---------------------
Implement an interface or abstract class for game screens with common methods like init(), update(), draw(), and dispose().

Individual Screen Classes
-------------------------
Implement each screen as a separate class that extends the game screen interface or abstract class:
   - NewGameScreen
   - RewardScreen
   - CustomizationScreen
   - BattleScreen
   - StoryScreen

Game Screen Manager
-------------------
Create a GameScreenManager class to manage the active screen and handle transitions between screens. The manager should have methods like showScreen(GameScreen screen), hideScreen(GameScreen screen), and getActiveScreen().

Main Game Loop
--------------
In the main game loop, use the GameScreenManager to manage the active screen and update, draw, and handle user input accordingly.

Battle System
=============
Abilities and Mechanics
-----------------------
Damage Types and Tags
---------------------
- Physical: Weapon
  Physical damage is straightforward and brutal, relying on sheer force and weaponry to harm opponents. It includes slashing, piercing, and blunt attacks that are simple yet effective in most battles.
  
- Fire: Elemental
  Fire damage harnesses the destructive power of flames, scorching enemies and igniting surroundings. This elemental force is both a source of light and devastation, consuming anything in its path.

- Water: Elemental
  Water damage uses the fluid and adaptable nature of water to overwhelm foes. This type can drown, erode, or chill, making it versatile and formidable against those vulnerable to its currents.

- Earth: Elemental
  Earth damage draws from the solid, grounding power of the earth, using rocks, soil, and natural strength to crush and incapacitate. It is a reliable and resilient force, embodying stability and strength.

- Wind: Elemental
  Wind damage employs the swift and invisible force of the air, slicing through with gusts or buffeting opponents with powerful storms. It represents agility and the ever-present power of the atmosphere.

- Verdant: Elemental, Life
  Verdant damage is nature's wrath, wielding the life force of plants and the environment. It can entangle, poison, or rejuvenate, showcasing the dual nature of growth and decay inherent in the natural world.

- Poison: Death
  Poison damage is insidious and lingering, seeping into the body to cause prolonged suffering and eventual demise. This type symbolizes decay and corruption, slowly eroding life from within.

- Ice: Elemental
  Ice damage freezes and shatters, harnessing the chilling cold to immobilize and fracture. It embodies the harshness of winter, capable of halting even the fiercest flames and toughest defenses.

- Lightning: Elemental
  Lightning damage strikes with speed and intensity, using electrical currents to shock and burn. It is unpredictable and powerful, representing the raw energy of a storm and the precision of a lightning bolt.

- Force: Magic
  Force damage uses pure magical energy to create kinetic impacts, pushing, pulling, or crushing targets with invisible strength. It is the essence of magical might without elemental alignment.

- Necrotic: Magic, Death
  Necrotic damage saps life and vitality, leaving nothing but decay and death in its wake. It is a dark magic that embodies entropy and the inevitable end, feared for its ability to drain the essence of life.

- Radiant: Magic, Life
  Radiant damage is the embodiment of light and purity, burning away darkness and evil with its brilliance. It is often associated with holy power, capable of healing and destroying in equal measure.

- Shadow: Magic, Death
  Shadow damage weaves through darkness, using the absence of light to harm and confuse. It represents the unseen threats and the lurking fears, a magic that thrives in the void.

- Psychic: Magic, Mental
  Psychic damage attacks the mind, using mental prowess to disrupt thoughts and overwhelm the senses. It is a subtle and powerful force, bending reality through sheer will and intellect.

- Arcane: Magic, Cosmic
  Arcane damage taps into the fundamental forces of the universe, wielding ancient and esoteric magic. It is the purest form of magical energy, connecting to the cosmic truths and the fabric of reality.

- Holy: Magic, Life
  Holy damage channels divine energy, smiting the unholy and healing the righteous. It is the light of sanctity, used to protect and purify, often associated with the divine and sacred.

- Dark: Magic, Death
  Dark damage harnesses the power of evil and malevolence, using curses and shadowy forces to weaken and destroy. It is the antithesis of holy power, thriving in corruption and fear.

- Temporal: Cosmic, Death
  Temporal damage manipulates time, aging foes prematurely or trapping them in endless loops. It is a cosmic force that intersects with the inevitability of death, altering the very fabric of existence.

- Void: Cosmic, Mental
  Void damage draws from the emptiness beyond reality, using the abyss to unnerve and annihilate. It is a mental and cosmic force, representing the ultimate unknown and the dissolution of existence.

- Astral: Cosmic
  Astral damage channels the energies of the stars and the ether, tapping into the mystical and otherworldly. It is a cosmic force that connects the physical and the spiritual, guiding and disrupting with celestial power.

- Celestial: Cosmic, Life
  Celestial damage uses the light and power of the heavens, a cosmic force that nurtures life and eradicates darkness. It embodies the divine and the eternal, bringing both salvation and judgment from above.
