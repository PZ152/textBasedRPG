Made you look


Code is made using Processing 4.3, basically Java with some quirks. For no other reason than it's what I've used the most.
Processing has an IDE that is small and can run the code, you just need to save as textBasedRPG.pde, open in processing and run the code.
I've been using Visual Studio Code with Processing plugins to code in, takes some setting up get it functional and running code, chatGPT helped instruct me there too.
VS Code has many more features and can use Amazon Q, a coding AI built into the editor, but tbh I havent even started using that, only installed.
Collapsing functions and navigating the code though are much easier when the code is so long. I could split it into files and will eventually, but keeping all the code in one file makes feeding chatGPT updates very easy and consistent. 
For some reason the normal Java Character.isDigit(char) and Character.isLetterOrDigit(char) aren't available, so methods are manually implemented when needed.


INSTALL
Unzip TextRPG Program Files into their own folder.
> Run TextBasedRPG.exe from folder
(Java not included, some may need to install OpenJDK 17)


Notes about current state!
-New Game has been abandoned while building the foundation and custom battle setup
- pre-made battles, Loading and Saving custom battles not yet implemented
- adding abilities in the ability selection screen not fully implemented - needs to ask ability classType first, not allowed to edit classType of existing abilities
- [EDIT: this is fixed now] its been a while since I worked on the battle screen, spacing and scrolling seem to be broken
